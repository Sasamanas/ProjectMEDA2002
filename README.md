# A project summary
There are 4 objectives which are 
1.Overall of suicide statistic that compares by sex and compares by a range of age in each country or group country showing by map and bar chart.
2. The trend of the most n countries of average suicide number showing in each year
3. The total suicide number grouping by ages in each year 
4. The total suicide number grouping by sex in each year. 

The first objective,using the geovisualisation to represent the world map and use the bar charts to show suicide number that compares by age in each country and sex. 

The second objective, using the multiple line chart to represent the top n of suicide country. For example, the top 3 of suicide countries are Russia, USA, JAPAN. Furthermore, the visualisation has regression line to forecast the suicide future trend.

The third objective, using the scatterplot to shows the suicide number in each age and in each year. Moreover, using regression line to forecast the suicide future trend. 

The fourth objective, using the scatterplot to shows the suicide number in each sex and in each year. Moreovr, this visaulisation also has regression line for forecast the suicide future trend.
