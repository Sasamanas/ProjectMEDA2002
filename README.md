# ProjectMEDA2002

# A project summary
There are 4 objectives which are 
1. Overall of suicide statistic that compares by sex and compares by a range of age in each country or group country showing by map and bar chart.
2. The trend of the most n countries of average suicide number showing in each year
3. The total suicide number grouping by ages in each year 
4. The total suicide number grouping by sex in each year. 

The first objective,using the geovisualisation to represent the world map and use the bar charts to show suicide number that compares by age in each country and sex. 

The second objective, using the multiple line chart to represent the top n of suicide country. For example, the top 3 of suicide countries are Russia, USA, JAPAN. Furthermore, the visualisation has regression line to forecast the suicide future trend.

The third objective, using the scatterplot to shows the suicide number in each age and in each year. Moreover, using regression line to forecast the suicide future trend. 

The fourth objective, using the scatterplot to shows the suicide number in each sex and in each year. Moreovr, this visaulisation also has regression line for forecast the suicide future trend.

We remove all row that have NULL value in Suicide No and Population.

# Contribution of each team member. 

Sasa Manasboonpermpoon 20302647: objective 2 and objective 4
Pakcheera Choppradit 20303349 : objective 1 and objective 3
Both of us helped each other to do Readme.md and slide.


# A clear description of how to execute/run the project and on which platform.

Firstly, we import data (who_suicide_statistics.csv) to R to clean it and save to name Cleandata_1.csv for use in Tableau. Then we do each objective in following :
R (ggplot2 and plotly) : objective 3 and  objective 4
Tableau :  objective 1 and objective 2.

# Any related media: visuals and screenshots. 

Objective 1 : Overall of suicide statistic that compares by sex and compares by a range of age in each country or group country showing by map and bar chart.
